This project analyzes employee retention using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression. The dataset contains HR employee records including satisfaction level, working hours, promotions, salary, and department.

The project explores which factors influence whether employees leave or stay, visualizes salary and department impact on retention, and builds a logistic regression model to predict employee turnover.

The final model evaluates prediction accuracy and provides insights into key drivers of employee attrition.
